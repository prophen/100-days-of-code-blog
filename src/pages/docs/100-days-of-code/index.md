The challenge has already started here - https://github.com/prophen/100-days-of-code. 

I decided I want to make my log prettier and more organized. I will write the daily log formatted as documentation.

I've attempted this several times and I have yet to get to the end of the challenge. I'm ready now and I wont give up until I reach day 100.

My focus is on documentation and learning git. I only had my first successful rebase yesterday (Feb. 15, 2020). I know git is powerful and I want to learn how to use it well.
