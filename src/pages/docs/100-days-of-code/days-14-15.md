I have some kind of virus so I haven't been super productive over the last few days. I managed to start and finish my Swift homework on days 14-15.

This week's module was functions so we finally get to solve some more interesting problems. I'm still grateful for my background in programming. 

> My `fibonacci` function from homework. I'm not sure it's the most elegant solution, but it works.
```Swift
func fibonacci(number: Int) -> Int {
    if number < 0 {
        let absoluteValue = abs(number)
        
        if number == -1 {
            return 1
        }
        
        return absoluteValue % 2 == 0 ?
            (fibonacci(number: (absoluteValue - 1)) + fibonacci(number: (absoluteValue - 2))) * -1 :
            fibonacci(number: (absoluteValue - 1)) + fibonacci(number: (absoluteValue - 2))
    }
    return number <= 1 ? number : fibonacci(number: (number - 1)) + fibonacci(number: (number - 2))
}
```

These early assignments aren't challenging for me but life outside of school is intense right now. I can use a break and something relatively easy to do.
