It's day 11 and I haven't written in the GitHub log since day 7. I've still been coding and making posts on Twitter at the least.

Added logout to the React frontend for the WordPress site.

Today I wrote a plugin for WordPress. I used PHP many years ago. I never felt I had a grasp of it and it's still looks very foreign to me.

I'm motivated to do cool things with WordPress and APIs and the best way I see to do what I want to do is to write PHP. I shortly considered staying in the relative comfort of React but that would mean a lot of unneeded code and additional resources to do something that PHP can handle fine on its own.
