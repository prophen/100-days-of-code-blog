Last night I worked on notes after merging my day 2 branch to master.

I will not be taking notes on the serverless course tonight. I'm tired and cranky.

I did finish and submit my Swift homework today. The topic was Control Flow. 

- `if` statements
- `switch` statements
- Ternary operators

Today was the first time I wrote out my exercises in an Xcode playground instead of in an online Swift repl.

I learned that the `.playground` file is a package. Inside of it is the `.swift` file I needed to submit as my completed assignment.
