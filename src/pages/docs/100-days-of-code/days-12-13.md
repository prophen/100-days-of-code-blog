I started [this Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/become-a-wordpress-developer-php-javascript/) and it's been my coding practice for the past two days. I enjoy Brad Schiff's teaching style. It's not too fast nor too slow and everything he teaches is in context and for a reason.


## Home Page
>![Styled Home Page](images/home.jpg)
Using the provided stylesheets and scripts we made created the styled home page.

## About Page
>![About Us Page](images/about-us.png)
The HTML for this page was also provided. We added WordPress functions so that the correct title shows on the page and in the title bar. Also added conditional rendering for parent and child pages.

##  Our Goals (child of About Us)
>![Our Goals Page](images/our-goals.png)
This is an example of a child page. There is a breadcrumb menu under the title that dynamically generates the link that takes you back to the parent page. Parent pages don't have that menu as you can see on the About Us page.
