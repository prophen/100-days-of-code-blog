Resources I used today
- https://www.linkedin.com/learning/installing-and-running-ruby-on-rails-5-mac/mysql?u=24867419

   Had a false start with this one. Trying to install mysql2 didn't work. I figured it was an old tutorial and I went back to progate where I found the tutorials for setting up my environment.

   Heroku doesn't use sqlite3 so I needed to change over to pg before I could deploy.

   `tail /usr/local/var/log/postgres.log`
   I found out how to inspect the server log here. This was the key to finding the bug. I was using version 12 of postgres and I needed version 11.
