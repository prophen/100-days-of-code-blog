I'm going to continue to learn the hub CLI and try creating a PR for each day of code log entry. 

I misunderstood the boilerplate instructions for creating a PR from hub. I am making a test branch to try again.

So far I've created a pull request from the command line using hub

https://github.com/prophen/100-days-of-code/pull/1

and created a gist from the command line to hold my post templates.
